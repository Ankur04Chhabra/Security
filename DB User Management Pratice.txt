Requirement:

There are 3 teams are working in development of project.

1: create separate users for each team for a particular database and track their activity.
2: Assign database level permission as follows:
	
	a:) Select permission of all tables except two table.
	b:) View definition permission to all users.
	c:) Execute stored procedure except two of them.
	d:) Alter permission to only one Team(Admin Team).
	e:) Database backup/create permission to Admin Team only.

3: Create Roles for all these permissions and assign to these users(Two roles will be created).
4: Add these 5 users in Windows AD Group and assign this group to Teams.  


Solution
2:) 

STEP 1: Allow datareader fixed database role to all 3 users.
STEP 2: Deny select statement on two objects to all 3 users

eg: Deny 

use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
DENY SELECT ON [dbo].[CM_TB_DOCUMENT_CONTENT] TO [Admin]
GO
use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
DENY SELECT ON [dbo].[CM_TB_DOCUMENT_GROUP] TO [Admin]
GO


b:) Grant View defintion to all 3 users
eg:

use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO [Admin]
GO

GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO [OPS]
GO
GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO [FINANCE]
GO



c:) Grant Execute permission to all 3 users

use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
GRANT EXECUTE TO [Admin]
GO
GRANT EXECUTE TO [OPS]
GO
GRANT EXECUTE TO [FINANCE]
GO

-- Deny Execute permiision from selected stored procedure to selected user

DENY EXECUTE ON DBO.[CM_SP_GetWorkflowHistory] TO [FINANCE]
GO


d:) Alter permission to Admin Team


use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
GRANT ALTER TO [Admin]

-- Grant Alter permission to specific object to spectific user
use [CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR]
GO
GRANT ALTER ON [dbo].[CM_TB_DOCUMENT_CONTENT] TO [Admin]
GO


3:) Part :: 1

Create First role for Developers and assign permissions


USE CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
GO
GRANT SELECT TO [DEVELOPMENT_ROLE]
GO
USE CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
GO

DENY SELECT ON CM_TB_DOCUMENT_CONTENT TO [DEVELOPMENT_ROLE]
DENY SELECT ON CM_TB_DOCUMENT_GROUP TO [DEVELOPMENT_ROLE]

USE CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
GO

GRANT EXECUTE TO [DEVELOPMENT_ROLE]

USE CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
GO

GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO [DEVELOPMENT_ROLE]


---Check Role and its permission with Assigned users


SELECT * FROM 
(
SELECT PRI.name,PRI.type_desc,CASE WHEN is_fixed_role=1 THEN 'Fixed Database Role' ELSE 'User Defined Database Role' END AS ROLE_TYPE,
PER.class_desc,OBJECT_NAME(PER.MAJOR_ID) AS [OBJECT],PER.permission_name,PER.state_desc,
(SELECT name FROM sys.DATABASE_PRINCIPALS WHERE principal_id=  RM.member_principal_id) AS ROLE_HOLDER_PRINCIPAL
FROM sys.database_principals AS PRI 
INNER JOIN sys.database_permissions AS PER 
ON PRI.principal_id=PER.grantee_principal_id
INNER JOIN sys.database_role_members AS RM ON RM.role_principal_id=PRI.principal_id
WHERE PRI.principal_id=10
) AS TBL ORDER BY ROLE_HOLDER_PRINCIPAL


Part 2:) Create Role for Admin Only for Admin Purpose

use CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
go

SELECT * FROM sys.fn_builtin_permissions('')

go

USE CCTNS_STATE_DB_OD_V3_HR
GO

GRANT BACKUP DATABASE TO [Admin_Role]
GRANT ALTER ANY SCHEMA TO [Admin_Role]
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO [Admin_Role]
GRANT CREATE VIEW TO [Admin_Role]
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO [Admin_Role]
GRANT CREATE FUNCTION TO [Admin_Role]

GRANT BACKUP LOG TO [Admin_Role]

-- While Granting Create Database permission it through error as

CREATE DATABASE permission can only be granted in the master database.
Msg 0, Level 11, State 0, Line 15
A severe error occurred on the current command.  The results, if any, should be discarded.

It means a user who want to create database  that user must be present in master database in user list.
so first create the user with Admin in master database.then grant permission to user(Admin).

GRANT CREATE DATABASE TO [Admin]


After granting create table/view/sp/function permission , table/view/sp/fun does not created as they throguh error as

Msg 2760, Level 16, State 1, Procedure sp_test, Line 1 [Batch Start Line 12]
The specified schema name "dbo" either does not exist or you do not have permission to use it.

To relove this error , Grant ALTER ANY SCHEMA permission to user.
